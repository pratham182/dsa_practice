//object oriented programing


//functional programming
//in this there is function (not too good)
//we want to  make detail of students in a class btech


#include<iostream>
#include<string>
using namespace std;

//class == bundle of properties and behaviour
class Student{
    //properties
    int id;
    int age;
    string name;
    int nos;
       
       //behaviour

     void study();
     void bunk();
     void gaming();
};

int main()
{

//problem



//we have to make too much variable it's very difficult
//so it's very difficult for us to implement it .
// difficult to  expand 
//diffiucult for maintaince




//father of oops said can we make student a real life entity 
//some behavious and states (properties)
//properties(states) == id,name,marks,nos,age
//behaviour == study,cheating,bunk,gaming
